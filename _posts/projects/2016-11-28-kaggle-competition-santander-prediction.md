Under their current system, a small number of Santanderâ€™s customers receive many recommendations while many others rarely see any
resulting in an uneven customer experience. In their second competition, Santander is challenging Kagglers to predict which products 
their existing customers will use in the next month based on their past behavior and that of similar customers.

In this project I explore the dataset and try to predict the products that the customer will buy.
