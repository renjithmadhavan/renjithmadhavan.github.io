Now a days most of my time is spend on learning new data science techniques by hands on as well as reading a ton of literature. 
Having read books such as that from Linoff and Berry and the likes, I understand there is still a lot to learn.

I have tried Microsoft Azure many times, however today I decided to try my hands on a very common problem that is “Customer Churn”
while reading this book [Predictive-Analytics-Microsoft-Machine-Learning][book1]

What surprised me was the ease with which I could experiment with a customer churn problem.  
I decided to experiment the orange dataset for the churn problem from KDD 2009.

I could easily play with the decision tree parameters and score and evaluate the models with much each.

This is simple democratization of data science. You dont need a data scientist to do this analysis.

Of course if you are looking for more control and your own customized solutions you need the R and Python way. 
Even in that case the Azure ML studio offers a great platform for machine learning.
